# Spec in spans

Specifying the structure of trace and metric data in logs.

## Motivation


Joshua MacDonald Jun 11 22:24
HI all, I've been thinking about how this Logging sub-project could help more with tracing and metrics. I was thinking that before beginning to work on Logging API design, we could try to standardize the translation from Span and Metric events into structured logging events. This was requested as a feature for the metric SDK (open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification#617), and I think the same could be said of spans. Right now many OTel repos are including standard-output exporters for both trace and metrics, but there are no standard conventional data formats for them to use, so it's a bit arbitrary what you get. I think it would be great if we had a standard structured log form for both metrics and spans.
I would add that the OTel metrics API was conceived as a logging API from the start. The data model describes metric events, which can be recorded as a faithful way to capture metrics, so we would just need to standardize how they are structured as log records. Here's the event structure: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/master/specification/metrics/api.md#metric-event-format

Why should we make this change? What new value would it bring? What use cases does it enable?

## Explanation

Explain the proposed change as though it was already implemented and you were explaining it to a user. Depending on which layer the proposal addresses, the "user" may vary, or there may even be multiple.

We encourage you to use examples, diagrams, or whatever else makes the most sense!

## Internal details

From a technical perspective, how do you propose accomplishing the proposal? In particular, please explain:

* How the change would impact and interact with existing functionality
* Likely error modes (and how to handle them)
* Corner cases (and how to handle them)

While you do not need to prescribe a particular implementation - indeed, OTEPs should be about **behaviour**, not implementation! - it may be useful to provide at least one suggestion as to how the proposal *could* be implemented. This helps reassure reviewers that implementation is at least possible, and often helps them inspire them to think more deeply about trade-offs, alternatives, etc.

## Trade-offs and mitigations

What are some (known!) drawbacks? What are some ways that they might be mitigated?

Note that mitigations do not need to be complete *solutions*, and that they do not need to be accomplished directly through your proposal. A suggested mitigation may even warrant its own OTEP!

## Prior art and alternatives

What are some prior and/or alternative approaches? For instance, is there a corresponding feature in OpenTracing or OpenCensus? What are some ideas that you have rejected?

## Open questions

What are some questions that you know aren't resolved yet by the OTEP? These may be questions that could be answered through further discussion, implementation experiments, or anything else that the future may bring.

## Future possibilities

What are some future changes that this proposal would enable?
